Part 1: 
1. The purpose of the website is to introduce Alzheimer’s Disease to people who didn’t have much knowledge about it. Besides the scientific knowledge, audiences can also learn about the life of Alzheimer’s patients.
2. I included the definition of the disease, the scientific explanation of its cause, different stages of the disease, current situation, movie clip about the disease, and a process of how people go through the disease. 
3. One interesting part of the website is its interactive story-telling section. People can click on the story section and scroll the page to view the process of how Alzheimer’s patients gain and gradually lose memory. Usually, people only have access to the scientific knowledge of this kind of diseases. My design of the interactive story section may convey a sense of empathy and help users understand the disease from another perspective. Also, I included many animation effects in the website, so users will have an engaging experience when scrolling through the web pages. 
4. Target audiences are people who are interested in Alzheimer’s disease but haven’t had much knowledge about it. 

Part 2:
1. Scroll through the story page. It creates a feeling of ‘experience’.
2. Click on basic web page buttons. Clicking ‘Story’ on the navigation bar or button in the 'Explore' section will lead users to the page of story. Clicking on other section of the navigation bar will lead users to certain position of the same page. 
3. Users can scroll through the main page to view more information, and some images and text will jump out as scrolling.
4. Clicking on the movie image in 'Alice' section will lead users to a YouTube page. 

Part 3:
1. Skrollr
2. It creates smooth scrolling effect relating to position and parallax effect
3. I use it as a part of the navigation bar to show progress as scrolling and fix image position as scrolling
4. As users scroll, different parts of navigation bar will be highlighted and the images are fixed on the ‘story’ page
 
1. CSS3 animation
2. It includes many animation effects
3. I used its different classes to link with many objects 
4. Many images and text appear with animation

1. Bootstrap 
2. To make the website response 
3. I included bootstrap class with object position
4. The website can be responsive with Bootstrap 

Part 4:
The story section used to be placed at the beginning. Since some people may be confused before reading about the information on the main page, I moved it to the end of the main page. 

Part 5:
I had lots of trouble with implementing the animations, especially with parallax. Sometimes the images just randomly disappear for no reason, and I had to try lots of ways to debug. Also, it is hard to look for the right library, I spent many time searching and testing.
