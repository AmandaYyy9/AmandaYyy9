1. I found that some versions of safari doesn't support local storage. Just use Chrome if some images on product detail page don't load. (I checked with my TA during lab)
2. Product detail page interactive functions:
		a. using left and right arrow to change image 
		b. click on small images to change the main image 
		c. click on color squares to change color
		d. change filling
		e. change quantity 
		f. Add to cart (cart icon changes with quantity)
3. I'm half way through 6B, so I just linked a static cart html file with product detail page. The interactive and storage features for 6B are in its own js file (web1.js => also in the folder)
